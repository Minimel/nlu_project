# Natural Language Understanding - ETH Zurich, Spring 2018
## Project 1: RNN Language Modelling with Tensorflow and Continuation of Sentences

The goal of this project was to build a simple language model based on a recurrent neural network with LSTM cells.

**Note**: Tensorflow cells were used, but the actual RNN had to be built.

### Steps
Part 1 - A: Train the model and compute sentence perplexity on the evaluation set <br />
Part 1 - B: Use word embeddings (word2vec), then repeat step A <br />
Part 1 - C: Increase hidden dimensionality, then repeat step A <br />
Part 2: Predict the next word given the previous hidden state and the previous word.


### Files
- **main.py**
- **model_lstm.py** - Defines the recurrent neural network with LSTM cells
- **config.py** - Contains the configuration variables used in the project
- **data_utilities.py** - Used for data preprocessing (tokenizing first 28 words of sentence, adding special tokens
 (`<bos>`, `<eos>`, `<unk>`, `<pad>`),...)
- **training_utils.py** - Contains conversion from word to vector (and vice versa), and creates batches for training purposes
- **testing_utils.py**
- **load_embeddings.py**
- **evaluation.py** - Used for computation of sentence perplexity: outputs a file of the form "group20.perplexityX" (X refering to the experiment A, B or C)



### Note
- To run the code, one must have the data files (`sentences.train`, `sentences.test`, `sentences.continuation`) in a `./data` folder at the same level as the task1 folder

- To visualize graph in Tensorboard, type in terminal:<br />
`$ tensorboard --logdir=/*path-to-project*/tas/runs/*run-IDnumber*/summaries/train`<br />

**To copy files or directories to cluster**<br/>
From cluster:
- Log in with `ssh *username*@login.leonhard.ethz.ch` (for euler cluster, use `ssh *username*@euler.ethz.ch`)
- Copy git directory directly to cluster using `git clone https://github.com/robertah/nlu_project.git` <br/>

From local terminal:
- Copy local files to cluster using `scp *path-to-file-in-local-directory* *username*@login.leonhard.ethz.ch:/cluster/home/*username*/*project-folder*` <br/>
  (Use `-r` to copy a directory)


**To run script on cluster** <br/>
From cluster:
- `$ cd *path-to-directory*` (for example, `$ cd /cluster/home/*username*/project_nlu/task1`)
- `$ module load python_gpu/3.6.1` (check https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Leonhard_beta_testing to see which version to load)
- `$ pip install --user *package-to-install*` (in this case, install tensorflow=1.7 and gensim)
- `$ bsub -n 4 -R "rusage[mem=20000, ngpus_excl_p=1]" -oo *name-of-output-file.txt* -J *name-of-job* "python main.py"`
